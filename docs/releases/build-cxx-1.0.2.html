<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>

<h3><a name="fix1">1. instanceof operator is now supported.</a></h3>

<P>In Flash 6 (Flash MX) the instanceof operator was added to Actionscript to allow runtime type checking of objects:</P>

<pre>
    var obj = new MyClass;

    if (obj instanceof MyClass)
    {
        ...
    }
</pre>

<P>This build updates the parser to support the instanceof operator. Previous releaes would generate an error when parsing a script containing instanceof.</P>

<h3><a name="fix2">2. delete operator is now supported.</a></h3>

<P>In previous releases of Translate objects or variables were deleted using the delete function:</P>

<pre>
    var obj = new MyClass;

    delete(obj);
</pre>

<P>This release now also allows delete to be used as an unary operator:</P>

<pre>
    var obj = new MyClass;

    delete obj;
</pre>
