<h3><a name="fix1">1. Multiple assignments now support object attributes.</a></h3>

<P>In ActionScript several variables can be assigned a value in a single statement:</P>

<pre>
    var a = b = c = 0;
</pre>

<P>The previous release of Translate added support for multiple assignments, however only variables were supported. Code that included dereferencing an object's attributes caused a parse error to be generated:</P>

<pre>
    var a = object.attribute = 1;
</pre>

<P>This release updates the parser to support both variables and attributes in assignment statements.</P>
